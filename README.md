### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, a Technical Project Manager from Perth Australia ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º, currently living in Paris ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·.

I haven't been all that active on GitHub, but I'll be uploading a lot more in the coming weeks. Watch this space.

ğŸ–‹ Languages:
- Python 
- Javascript (basic)
- R 
- SQL 

ğŸ’¼ What I'm Currently Working On:
- I'm teaching myself react so I can build pretty UI's for my coming projects ğŸŒ¸
- I'm working on building an automated smart home system using raspberry pi and IoT sensors (C02 sensors, humiditiy & temperature sensors). I'll have this system interface with OpenAI's API's so it can act as a personal assistant as well.
