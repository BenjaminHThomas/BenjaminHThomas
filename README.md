### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, I recently left my job as a Technical Project Manager in Perth ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, and moved to Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.

Currently job hunting, so if you are a recruiter, hiring manager or happen to know of an open position, please don't hesitate to contact me.

<br/>

ðŸ–‹ Languages:
- Python 
- R 
- SQL
- C (beginner)
<br/><br/>

ðŸ’¼ My recent projects:
  
  - Real-estate webscraper ([here](https://github.com/BenjaminHThomas/Paris-RE-Scraper)). It goes through all the listings of Paris properties for sale or rent on bienici.com & Seloger and stores them in a mysql database.
  - A very quick analysis workbook on the real estate data [here](https://github.com/BenjaminHThomas/paris-re-analysis/blob/main/exploration_1.ipynb). In the workbook I clean the data, do some basic analysis and feature engineering, and some modelling with a randomforest regression model.
  - Very soon I'll begin work on a c-based text editor. Similar to vim, just much simpler. 

<br/><br/>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - JS and react so that I can build a pretty and responsive websites.
  - C

<br/><br/>
