### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, I recently left my job as a Technical Project Manager in Perth ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, and moved to Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. If you're a recruiter or know of positions I'd be suitable for, please get in touch.
<br/>

ðŸ–‹ Languages:
- Python 
- R 
- SQL
- C
<br/><br/>

ðŸ’¼ My recent projects:
  - During my previous role at Ventia I built a system, named the "Automatic Pricing System", that automatically selects the best-value subcontractor for infrastructure projects nationally. I can't share the code but would be happy to discuss.
  - Real-estate webscraper ([here](https://github.com/BenjaminHThomas/Paris-RE-Scraper)). It goes through all the listings of Paris properties for sale or rent on bienici.com & Seloger and stores them in a mysql database. You can find an analysis workbook ([here](https://github.com/BenjaminHThomas/paris-re-analysis/blob/main/exploration_1.ipynb)).
  - [minishell](https://github.com/BenjaminHThomas/minishell): a miniature version of the bash command line interface. 

<br/>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - I was recently accepted into school42 [(Ecole42)](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) in Paris. I'm working through the common core units, which involves low-level programming in C & C++. I will be making the repo's public once I've finished the units.
  - You have 18 months to complete the program, but I aim to be finished within 8 months.

<br/><br/>

ðŸ’¬ If you'd like to work with me on a project or just have a chat, please reach out to me.
